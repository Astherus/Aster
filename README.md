# AsterDex

Welcome to **AsterDex** – a next-generation decentralized perpetual contract trading platform designed for performance, community engagement, and security.

## What is AsterDex?

AsterDex ($AST) is a decentralized, multi-chain, perpetual contracts exchange platform, offering both deep liquidity and user-centric trading experience. In late 2024, Astherus merged with APX Finance, bringing together advanced yield products and sophisticated perpetual contract trading architectures, to deliver a comprehensive DeFi suite. Users can trade perpetual contracts, earn yield, and participate in the protocol’s growth – all on-chain.

**Core Features:**
- Multi-chain support (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Scroll)
- Two trading modes: Pro Mode (order book interface) & 1001x (one-click, MEV-resistant perpetual trading)
- Competitive fees, high performance
- Yield products: asBNB (BNB liquid staking), USDF (yield dollar), asBTC, asCAKE
- Support for advanced on-chain features: Zero-knowledge proofs, intent-based matching, Layer 1 chain integration (future roadmap)
- Community oriented governance & rewards
